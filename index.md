# Design & Verification Engineer


## Professional Experience

### DD&V Engineer | Working Student [***@Racyics***](https://racyics.de/)
* Enhanced JTAG IP for production deployment by resolving critical bugs, ensuring IEEE standard compliance, and strengthening the verification infrastructure with custom UVM scoreboards, assertions, and integration tests.
* Designed and implemented verification components for clock gating and power mode logic in a complex industry-grade SoC, with hands-on experience in UVM-based IP verification and AMBA protocol validation; additionally supported ROM generation and integration for physical implementation.
* Streamlined verification flows by improving scripts, tooling, and reusable components, and authored detailed IP and VIP documentation, reducing integration overhead and accelerating onboarding for future projects.

### Studentische Hilfskraft (SHK) [***@CFAED***](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/)
* Designed and implemented an experimental hardware-assisted Federated Learning framework for IoT applications, enabling distributed training across decentralized edge devices while ensuring data privacy.
* Applied model optimization techniques, including quantization, to reduce neural network size and computational overhead while preserving accuracy, making the framework more resource-efficient for edge deployment.

### Digital Design and Verification Engineer [***@CTS-CINVESTAV***](https://cts-design.gdl.cinvestav.mx/acerca.html)
* Developed and executed UVM-based test benches for functional verification of experimental RTL designs, ensuring correctness and robustness.
* Implemented synthesis and physical design flows using Cadence Genus and Innovus, from RTL to layout, validating design rule compliance.
* Designed and characterized custom logic cells in Cadence Virtuoso for a proprietary PDK, contributing to the IP library development.
* Built Dockerized environments integrating open-source flows to enable reproducible RTL-to-GDSII training setups and facilitate onboarding.

## Some Personal Projects
### Generator Concept for Complex SoC Designs
Focused on developing a framework for complex System-on-Chip generation. The goal was to integrate Racyics‚Äô existing toolchain into a flow where SoC configurations can be created from declarative descriptions (YAML). This work addressed a practical need: to reduce manual effort and potential errors in SoC prototyping, while improving consistency and flexibility in design space exploration.
### [iPod Classic Bluetooth integration](https://github.com/Saacman/ipod_avr_control)
Used an ATTiny microcontroller to seamlessly integrate bluetooth 5.2 functionality to the beloved iPod Classic 6th Gen. The project includes the source code, as well as the PCB designed to integrate the power control directly into the iPod PMU and clickwheel buttons.
