# Design & Verification Engineer

#### Technical Skills: Hola


## Professional Experience

### DD&V Engineer | Working Student [_@Racyics_](https://racyics.de/)
* Enhanced JTAG IP for production deployment by resolving critical bugs, ensuring IEEE standard compliance, and strengthening the verification infrastructure with custom UVM scoreboards, assertions, and integration tests.
* Designed and implemented verification components for clock gating and power mode logic in a complex industry-grade SoC, with hands-on experience in UVM-based IP verification and AMBA protocol validation; additionally supported ROM generation and integration for physical implementation.
* Streamlined verification flows by improving scripts, tooling, and reusable components, and authored detailed IP and VIP documentation, reducing integration overhead and accelerating onboarding for future projects.

### Studentische Hilfskraft (SHK) [_@CFAED_](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/)
* Designed and implemented an experimental hardware-assisted Federated Learning framework for IoT applications, enabling distributed training across decentralized edge devices while ensuring data privacy.
* Applied model optimization techniques, including quantization, to reduce neural network size and computational overhead while preserving accuracy, making the framework more resource-efficient for edge deployment.

### Digital Design and Verification Engineer [_@CTS-CINVESTAV_](https://cts-design.gdl.cinvestav.mx/acerca.html)
* Developed and executed UVM-based test benches for functional verification of experimental RTL designs, ensuring correctness and robustness.
* Implemented synthesis and physical design flows using Cadence Genus and Innovus, from RTL to layout, validating design rule compliance.
* Designed and characterized custom logic cells in Cadence Virtuoso for a proprietary PDK, contributing to the IP library development.
* Built Dockerized environments integrating open-source flows to enable reproducible RTL-to-GDSII training setups and facilitate onboarding.
